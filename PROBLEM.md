## Problem Statement: Find perimeter of the rectangle##

**Given length and breadth of an rectangle calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.

**This exercise contains a class named LongestSpan with the following static method:**

     perimeterCalculator(double length,double breadth):double  
  
     - Method should take two numbers and return a number as result.
     - the logic for finding perimeter has to be implemented in this method

     getValues():void
    
     - get user input from the console using scanner
     - pass the values to method perimeterCalculator
     - print the return value from the method perimeterCalculator.   

## Example
    Sample Input:
    Enter length and breadth of the rectangle:
    12 10
    Expected Output:
    44.0
--------------------------------------------------------
    Sample Input:
    Enter length and breadth of the rectangle:
    105.45 200.10
    Expected Output:
    611.1
